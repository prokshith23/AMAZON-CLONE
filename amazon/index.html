        Karnataka Histroy
    </h1>
    <p id="one">Geographically, located on the southwestern part of South India, Karnataka has abundant natural and human resources. 
        It has Western Ghats with rich forest resources; plain valleys with rich and varied crop pattern; and narrow Coastal 
        line with many harbours including the New Mangaluru port. All these have enhanced the eeconomic stability of Karnataka.
         Moreover, Karnataka has a hoary past. It has the remains of numerous pre-historic settlements, innumerable inscriptions, 
         memorial Hero, mahasati and atmahuti (self-immolation) stones and monuments of rich historical and cultural heritage.

        Pre History

        K arnataka has many sites of Pre-historic period and most of
        them have found scattered on the river valleys of Krishna,
         Bhima, Malaprabha, Ghataprabha, Cauvery, Hemavathi, 
        Shimsha, Tungabhadra, Manjra, Pennar, and Netravati 
        and on their tributaries.It is very interesting 
        to note that the Pre-historic studies in India 
        started with the discovery of ash mounds at
         Kupgal and Kudatini in 1836 by Cuebold, a British officer in 
         Ballari region, which then formed part of Madras Presidency. 
         Subsequent discoveries have revealed the existence of Stone Age Culture \
         with innumerable Pre-historic sites in Karnataka.</p1>

    <p id="two">Humanistic education focuses on the holistic development of the 
        individual, emphasizing self-awareness, empathy, 
        and the cultivation of each student's unique potential. 
        It is a transformative approach that empowers learners 
        to navigate life's challenges with resilience and compassion.
